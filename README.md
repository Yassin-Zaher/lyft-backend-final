# Lyft Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program

### Overview
I am pleased to present this code repository as evidence of my completion of the Lyft Back End Engineering virtual experience program. This program was designed to help me better understand the engineering lifecycle at Lyft and how different teams collaborate to create a successful product. The program gave me insights into the technology stack used by Lyft and the methodology of coding for production-level systems. I also learned from experienced engineers about the best practices to follow in order to make sure that the ideas are implemented correctly and efficiently.
